                        <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The franchise includes comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.                          
                            The first film in the MCU was Iron Man (2008), which began a series of interconnected films, including The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Marvel's The Avengers (2012). The universe continued to expand with sequels and prequels to the original films, and new franchises, such as Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).
                            The MCU has been a major success and is one of the highest-grossing film franchises of all time. It has also received positive critical reception, with many praising the interconnected nature of the films and the performances of the cast, and has been credited for reinvigorating the superhero genre.
                        </p>
